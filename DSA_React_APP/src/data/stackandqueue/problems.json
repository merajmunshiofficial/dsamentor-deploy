These boundaries define the range where the current element is the minimum of all subarrays that contain it.\n   c. The number of subarrays where arr[i] is the minimum is (i - PSEE[i]) * (NSE[i] - i).\n   d. Multiply this count by arr[i] to get the total contribution of this element to the sum.\n5. We use monotonic stacks to efficiently find the PSEE and NSE for each element:\n   a. For PSEE, maintain a non-decreasing stack from left to right.\n   b. For NSE, maintain a non-increasing stack from right to left.\n6. Sum up the contributions of all elements to get the final result.\n7. The solution handles potential integer overflow by using long type for intermediate calculations.\n8. Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the array.\n9.

    "description": "Compute how much water can be trapped after raining given an elevation map.",
    "approach": "1. The problem asks us to calculate the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between bars of varying heights.\n2. The key insight is that for any position i, the water trapped at that position depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right, minus its own height (if the result is positive).\n3. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. The most efficient is the two-pointer approach:\n   a. Initialize two pointers: left at the beginning and right at the end of the array.\n   b. Also initialize two variables to keep track of the maximum height encountered so far from the left and from the right.\n   c. The idea is to process the bars from both ends, moving inward and calculating water trapped as we go.\n4. The algorithm works as follows:\n   a. While left < right:\n      i. If height[left] is less than or equal to height[right], focus on the left pointer:\n         - If leftMax is greater than the current height, we can trap water at this position equal to (leftMax - height[left]).\n         - Otherwise, update leftMax to the current height as no water can be trapped.\n         - Move the left pointer one step to the right.\n      ii. If height[left] is greater than height[right], focus on the right pointer:\n         - If rightMax is greater than the current height, we can trap water at this position equal to (rightMax - height[right]).\n         - Otherwise, update rightMax to the current height as no water can be trapped.\n         - Move the right pointer one step to the left.\n5. The two-pointer approach works because we only need to know the limiting wall (the smaller of the two max heights) for each position.\n6. By processing bars from both ends and always moving the pointer at the smaller height, we ensure that we have the necessary information to calculate trapped water at each step.\n7. Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of bars in the height array.\n8. Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.",
